# Digital-Porous-Media-Micro-CT-Scans-Features-Exctraction

This repository contains python codes used to muniulate and extract features from Mico CT scans of digital porous media.

The codes include:
1. Scaling Micro CT scans
2. Extracting the effective path of fluid flow through the porous medium (continous pore space)
3. Extraxting the ecuilidien distance features of the porous media pore space
4. Extrating the pores' centeriods corrdinates
5. Transforming the porous media micro ct scans from .raw format to stack of slices of 2D .png images
